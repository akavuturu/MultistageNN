# TODO List for July 17th

## To Do

-   write code based on 3d poission (https://github.com/huangynj/poisson) but generalized for high dim
-   write class that takes training data and does everything from there
-   Get compute time per dimension, and energy savings?
-   can we identify correlation between nn architecture and cpu time?
-   find nn architecture based on hitting accuracy
-   dont do all runs (1, 2, 3, 50, 100)
