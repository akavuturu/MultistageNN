# TODO List for July 17th

- Create slides on reproduced 1D and 2D examples from paper (Figures 5 and 6)
- Remove loop to increase data size in 1D and start high for Figure 5 data
- Reproduce sizes of frequency domain plots in Figure 6 (magnitude_spectrum_norm)
- Use different kappa values for each input from FFT

- Create slides on 1 vs 2 Kappa values for Figure 6

- Trade studies on architecture of NN (# layers, size of hidden layers)
