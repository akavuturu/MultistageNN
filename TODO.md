- Get compute time per dimension, and energy savings?
- can we identify correlation between nn architecture and cpu time?
- find nn architecture based on hitting accuracy
- dont do all runs (1, 2, 3, 50, 100)

## Questions

- Do I do fft on the eval dataset or just the small sample of training data?
