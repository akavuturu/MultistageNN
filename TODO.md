# TODO List for July 17th

## To Do

- Normalize residue by RMSE
- write code based on poission (<https://github.com/zheyuanhu01/SDGD_PINN/tree/main/Section_5.1>)
- Get compute time per dimension, and energy savings?
- can we identify correlation between nn architecture and cpu time?
- find nn architecture based on hitting accuracy
- dont do all runs (1, 2, 3, 50, 100)

## Questions

- rethink sampling and how this will work for multistage networks
